# SCH App
This small app contains tools for working more efficiently with the SCH EHR system. Currently, this includes:

* Shortcut keys for common actions in CIS
* A custom calculator

I also recommend [CLCL](http://www.nakka.com/soft/clcl/index_eng.html), which saves everything you copy to the clipboard, and [Launcy](http://launchy.net/), a app launcher.

Please contact me with suggestions or tools you'd like to see added, or if you want to help code!

This app is an [AutoHotKey](http://autohotkey.com/) script. [SCH.ahk](https://github.com/jonjlee/schapp/blob/master/SCH.ahk) is the main script. [Install SCH App.ahk](https://github.com/jonjlee/schapp/blob/master/Install%20SCH%20App.ahk) helps prevent the user from launching directly from a Citrix browser. [CalcFuns.ahk](https://github.com/jonjlee/schapp/blob/master/CalcFuns.ahk) contains functions that can be used from the calculator.
